react featurs
1) Single Page Application
2) Use JSX
3) Virtual dom
4) One way data binding
5) Easy learning curve

Single Page Application: React is based on single page application concept
single page application means in normal web application in which we are clicking on any button
or selecting option from navigation bar then then the web page is reloading then that means the application is
multi page application
But in singlepage application does not the web page reload and just updste the page 
whatever we wanted to change the the application is known as single page application 
When we create react application using CRA it always create the application which will be single
page application.

Virtual DOM: first of all we understand that what is dom so whenever the html css and 
javascript file goes to browser and run first time then it will create tree like structure
this structure is also known as document object model.
so react is used special like dom called virtual dom instead of rreal dom, other js framwork updates real dom which makes
the web application slow.
whenever any react application gets loaded on screen for the first time react component
gets mounted 
NOW when any user makes changes on the screen like button click bcz of which the state variable will get updated so
in this cases the change will not directly go to real DOM insteat react uses virtual dom 
so we are having two virtual dom one virtual dom created during mounting of component so it si a copy of real dom
and anpother virtual dom contains the new updates, states 
Now this two virtual dom will get compared to each other and will check for the new changes this 
complete procedure known as "diffing algorithm"
Now the new changes will be updated in our real dom this process is known as "Reconciliation"
So manupulating virtual dom is much faster 

JSX: react use JSX(JavaScript Syntax Extension) JSX is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. We can embed JavaScript objects inside the HTML elements.But JSX is not supported by the browsers, as a result Babel compiler transcompile the code into JavaScript code. JSX makes codes easy and understandable. It is easy to learn if we know HTML and JavaScript.

One Way data binding: a special feature is One-way Data Binding:Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.The data in react flows only in one direction i.e. the data is transferred from top to bottom i.e. from parent components to child components. The properties(props) in the child component cannot return the data to its parent component but it can have communication with the parent components to modify the states according to the provided inputs. This is the working process of one-way data binding. This keeps everything modular and fast.



Library v/s Framwork:
Library vs Framework? Library: -is a collection of functions -In case of library the Execution of code will be decided by the developers Means developers are in charge of the flow of the whole application. -We are choosing when and where to call the library. -in case of library its developers duty to design the structure. -library follows View model Framework: -Framework is a collection of multiple other libraries. -in case of framework the execution is already defined or decided.the framework is in charge of the flow of the whole application. -It provides some places for we have to plug in our code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed. -Framework provides you a structure in which we just put down the code our functionality. -it follows MVC structure (model view controller)
