 Javascript has two types of values: primitive values and reference values.
You can add, change, or delete properties to a reference value, whereas you cannot do it with a primitive value.
Copying a primitive value from one variable to another creates a separate value copy. It means that changing 
the value in one variable does not affect the other.

Copying a reference from one variable to another creates a reference so that two variables refer to 
the same object. This means that changing the object via one variable reflects in another variable.

    <script>
        // pass by value 
let x=5;
function passValue(a){
y=a;
y=y*y;
console.log("value of y after by passing value", y);
}

passValue(x);
console.log("value of x outside ", x);
// pass by refernce 

const obj = {
    name: "rohit",
    age: 28,
    gender: "male"
}


function passRef(b){
b.name="rakesh keer";
b.age+=20;
console.log("age after passing refernce", obj.age);
console.log("name of object property after passing refernce", obj.name);
}

passRef(obj);
console.log("name of object property before passing reference", obj.name);
console.log("age before passing refernce", obj.age);
